# NordBioMedNet Summer School 2019 in Computational Biomedicine - Imaging, machine learning and precision medicine

![Seili-2019 image](./assets/seili_2019.png)

`Seili-2019` is part of the "Open Educational Resources in Computational Biomedicine"* (OERCompBiomed) project conducted by the NordBioMed.org and funded by [Erasmus+](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/#project/bc4e0bdb-aa64-4d5c-a7f2-26d68ec36647).

NordBioMed is a collaborative network in the field of Biomedicine(*) between the Universities of Turku, Eastern Finland (Kuopio), Bergen, Odense and Karolinska Institutet. The network was originally formed in 2013 to strengthen the individual biomedical teaching programs within the component universities and make them internationally more competitive by providing complementary activities from the partner universities. The network supports both student and teacher mobility, organises intensive courses and develops virtual online teaching and an information platform on the [Open edX](https://open.edx.org/) platform, supported by a GitHub repository.

# Setting up your system

**Follow the instructions at [Setting up your system](setup.md) (`setup.md`) to get ready**

Note: To access the course notebooks interactively without downloading any software we are planning to use [Binder](https://mybinder.org), see also
[BinderHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub) and [try Jupyter without installing anything](https://jupyter.org/try)

# Notebooks
The course is based on the Jupyter Notebook, a web-based framework for developing and presenting code-based projects (take a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk og https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for introductions to Jupyter Notebooks).

Throughout the course you will work with notebooks that contain various material and programming tasks. We recommend that you *make a copy of our notebooks before you are editing them*. In this respect you might adopt the naming convention `my_[name_of_notebook].ipynb`.


## Get started - test your environment
* [Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Nibabel, Biopython and more](notebooks/0.0-test.ipynb): run through this notebook (`notebooks/0.0-test.ipynb`) to check that your environment is OK.<br>
