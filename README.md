`Seili-2019` is part of the "Open Educational Resources in Computational Biomedicine"* (OERCompBiomed) project conducted by the [NordBioMed.org](https://nordbiomed.org/news/summer-school-2019) and funded by [Erasmus+](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/#project/bc4e0bdb-aa64-4d5c-a7f2-26d68ec36647).

NordBioMed is a collaborative network in the field of Biomedicine(*) between the Universities of Turku, Eastern Finland (Kuopio), Bergen, Odense and Karolinska Institutet. The network was originally formed in 2013 to strengthen the individual biomedical teaching programs within the component universities and make them internationally more competitive by providing complementary activities from the partner universities. The network supports both student and teacher mobility, organises intensive courses and develops virtual online teaching and an information platform on the [Open edX](https://open.edx.org/) platform, supported by a GitHub repository.

# Setting up your system

**Follow the instructions at [Setting up your system](setup.md) (`setup.md`) to get ready**

Note: To access the course notebooks interactively without downloading any software we are planning to use [Binder](https://mybinder.org), see also
[BinderHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub) and [try Jupyter without installing anything](https://jupyter.org/try)

# Notebooks
The course is based on the Jupyter Notebook, a web-based framework for developing and presenting code-based projects (take a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk and https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for introductions to Jupyter Notebooks, and A. Rule et al. _Ten simple rules for writing and sharing computational analyses in Jupyter Notebooks_. [PLOS Computational Biology, July 25 2019](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007007)).

Throughout the course you will work with notebooks that contain various material and programming tasks. We recommend that you *make a copy of our notebooks before you are editing them*. In this respect you might adopt the naming convention `my_[name_of_notebook].ipynb`.
